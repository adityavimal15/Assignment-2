        PW Skills, the skilling vertical of Physics Wallah launched late last
        year, has outlined a plan to invest Rs 120 crore in the next two-three
        years to provide upskilling courses at competitive prices. "We want to
        address the issue of inaccessibility and steep pricing of most tech and
        upskilling courses, as well as the lack of practical training and
        teaching of basics. Additionally, there is a significant gap in training
        availability in vernacular languages. PW Skills is committed to bridging
        these gaps by investing Rs 120 crore in the next 2-3 years to provide
        quality content, taught from the basics by industry professionals, at
        competitive prices," said Prateek Maheshwari, Co-Founder of PW, in a
        statement. The platform currently has over 1.5 lakh registered learners,
        enrolled with its courses offered in Hindi, English, and "Hinglish".
        Among these learners, 50,000 have enrolled in paid batches, while the
        rest benefit from the free courses. About 30,000 learners hail from the
        Hindi heartland, encompassing regions such as Uttar Pradesh, Bihar,
        Madhya Pradesh, and other states, according to the statement. PW Skills
        provides hybrid courses in data science, Java, C++, full-stack web
        development, and other tech courses starting from Rs 3,500. The platform
        plans to expand into joint certification courses with colleges, diploma
        courses, and technology courses in vernacular languages. Additionally,
        The platform offers placement assistance through its job portal, with
        partnerships established with over 250 companies, including Tata IQ,
        Siemens, SAP, Oracle, and Amazon. Also Read
